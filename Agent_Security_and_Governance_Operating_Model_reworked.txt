AGENT SECURITY & GOVERNANCE OPERATING MODEL

1. AGENT ROLE MODEL

Roles and Responsibilities

Agent (Autonomous System)
- Executes predefined tasks within scoped domains
- Applies policies, prompts, and tools as configured
- Produces recommendations, actions, or artifacts

Human Operator
- Reviews high-risk or irreversible actions
- Provides approvals and overrides
- Owns final accountability for outcomes

Agent Owner
- Defines agent purpose and success criteria
- Approves capability scope and changes
- Accountable for business impact

Model Owner
- Selects and maintains LLMs and embeddings
- Manages model updates, performance, and safety

Data Owner
- Owns authoritative data sources
- Approves data access, retention, and sharing

Authority Boundaries
- Agents cannot expand scope, permissions, or tools
- Agents cannot self-modify prompts or policies
- Humans retain authority over irreversible actions

Dependency Relationships
- Agent depends on Model Owner for inference quality
- Agent depends on Data Owner for data correctness
- Agent Owner depends on audit logs for governance


2. BEHAVIOR & DECISION MODEL

Autonomous Decisions
- Information retrieval from approved sources
- Data transformation and summarization
- Low-risk recommendations and drafts

Human Approval Required
- External system writes
- User-impacting actions (emails, deletions, updates)
- Decisions with legal, financial, or safety impact

Explicitly Prohibited
- Acting outside defined role or domain
- Using unapproved data sources
- Generating deceptive, manipulative, or unsafe outputs

Risk Tolerance
- Low tolerance for irreversible actions
- Medium tolerance for advisory outputs
- Zero tolerance for policy violations


3. FAILURE & DEGRADATION MODEL

Failure Scenarios
- LLM unavailability or hallucination
- Stale, missing, or corrupted data
- Integration or API failures

Degraded Operating Modes
- Read-only advisory mode
- Cached knowledge mode
- Human-in-the-loop only mode

Stop Conditions
- Repeated policy violations
- Loss of auditability
- Detection of unsafe behavior
- On any stop condition, processing halts immediately and the run is escalated to human operational review before any resume.


4. TRUST BOUNDARIES & DATA ZONES

Data Zones

Authoritative Data
- Systems of record (databases, verified APIs)

Advisory Data
- Documents, wikis, external knowledge

Permissions
- Agents have least-privilege read access
- Write access restricted to approved workflows

Trust Assumptions
- Authoritative data is assumed accurate but may be incomplete or delayed
- Advisory data and policies may lag emerging risks or contain bias


5. EXPLAINABILITY & AUDIT MODEL

Explainable Decisions
- Any user-impacting recommendation
- Any automated action
- Any policy-relevant decision

Logging Requirements
- Inputs, outputs, prompts, and tool calls
- Policy checks and explicit decision rationale

Audit Trail
- Tamper-evident logs
- Retention aligned with compliance requirements
- Deterministic re-execution using identical inputs and versions


6. CHANGE & EVOLUTION MODEL

Changeable Elements
- Prompts and policies
- Integrations and tools
- Models and configurations

Approval Process
- Impact analysis
- Security and policy review
- Controlled rollout

Rollback Strategy
- Versioned prompts and configurations
- Immediate revert to last approved version
- Mandatory post-incident review


7. OPERATIONAL OWNERSHIP MODEL

Ownership
- Agent Owner: business accountability
- Data Owner: data integrity and access
- Model Owner: model behavior and safety

Incident Response
- Defined escalation paths
- On-call ownership
- Post-mortem required

Kill Switch Authority
- Agent Owner and Security Lead
- Immediate disablement capability
